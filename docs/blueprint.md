- Document Analysis Engine: Document Analysis Engine: Analyzes uploaded documents, extracting key information, matching content to framework requirements, detecting gaps, scoring quality, and tracking citations.  It uses an AI tool that parses the document, reasons about the extracted sections, and decides what information to include in the report.

- Gap Analysis & Recommendations: Gap Analysis Tool: Identifies areas where model documentation is lacking based on framework criteria.  Includes prioritized action items, implementation guides, resource library, cost-benefit analysis, and peer benchmarking. The LLM is a tool which helps decide what recommendations to provide.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted blue (#6699CC) to evoke a sense of trust, security, and intelligence, aligning with the app's goal of responsible AI evaluation. This avoids the cliche of "trustworthy blue" while still staying within the association.
- Background color: A very light gray (#F0F4F8) for a clean and modern look that is easy on the eyes, ensuring readability and focus on the assessment content.
- Accent color: A warm orange (#FFB347) is used sparingly for call-to-action buttons and key interactive elements. This creates a clear visual hierarchy and guides users through the assessment process.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for titles.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for the text. Together these create a modern, easily-legible, slightly techy style.
- Use simple, clear icons from a library like Lucide to represent different assessment categories and compliance levels, ensuring visual consistency and quick comprehension.
- A clean, modular layout that prioritizes readability and user guidance, using clear section headings, tooltips, and progressive disclosure to simplify complex assessments.
- Subtle animations to indicate progress, highlight key information, and acknowledge user actions, avoiding distracting or unnecessary visual effects.
