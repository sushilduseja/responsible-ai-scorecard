The application utilizes a component-based architecture with a focus on UI elements found in `src/components/ui`. AI-powered flows are likely integrated through the files in `src/ai/flows`.

To understand the application's structure and start exploring the code, begin by examining the main application files within the `src/app` directory, particularly `/src/app/page.tsx` and `/src/app/layout.tsx`. Configuration files like `/next.config.ts`, `/tsconfig.json`, and `/package.json` provide details about the project setup and dependencies.
